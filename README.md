An e-commerce website UI/UX project is the process of designing an online
store that is both visually appealing and easy to use. The goal of a good ecommerce website is to make it easy for customers to find the products
they want, and to encourage them to buy them.
My final project involved designing a comprehensive e-commerce website. 
From crafting a captivating landing page to optimizing the checkout process, I ensured that every aspect of the user journey was seamless and engaging.
